Junior Software Developer with 5 years experience in the music industry, and 8 years in tech.

My depth of knowledge is evidenced by my computing degree and industry experience.

In addition my studies at CodeClan have equipped me with the ability to learn new skill sets quickly and efficiently.

Through CodeClan Iâ€™ve gained not only knowledge but a thirst for more. I'm looking forward to a Full Stack or Back End Developer role.

The two things I love about coding are the problem solving aspects and the culture of collaboration.
